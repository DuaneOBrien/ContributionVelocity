???
"I am asking for a budget of $120,000 allocated in 2019 for distribution to open source projects which Indeed consumes. Each month, Indeed would distribute $10,000 to a project voted on by Indeedians who made an open source contribution that month. This would democratize where some of Indeed’s open source dollars go, while giving open source participants motivation to self-identify and engage with the program."
